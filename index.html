        <h2>Introducing Myself</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Michigan, along with my two siblings.
            I attended a private high school where I did well in my studies, played multiple sports and also studied the
            piano.
        </p>
        <p>I have experience working in several differents job fields, including most recently banking and retail.
            I also do work for and help out the family businesses. My future professional interests include a career in
            IT that will,
            ideally, involve some aspect of programming.
